tumblr-theme-bootstrap
======================

This is a Tumblr theme I wrote using Twitter's Bootstrap 3.
This theme is still a work in progress, so feel free to offer suggestions.
I wrote this theme to accomodate a mixture of longer text articles, photos, and embeded code samples while maintaing a clean, modern look.
There are a few CSS 3 effects in use, but they all degrade nicely.
It is written to work well on large screens (desktops) as well as smaller devices (tablets and large phones).

Niceties include
* [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/) (responsive layout)
* [jQuery 1.10.x](http://jquery.com/) 
* [Font Awesome 3.2.1](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)
* Disqus Integration
* Direct share links (no 3rd party library)
* GitHub [Gist-Embed](https://github.com/blairvanderhoof/gist-embed) (see this [article](http://blog.metatribal.com/post/58564063300/embedding-github-gists-in-tumblr))
